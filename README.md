# Minimalist Clock App
This app is a minimalist clock that gives an inspiration quote from [this](https://type.fit/api/quotes) API. It also calculates and shows week of the year, day of the year, and the week number, all while adjusting for leap years.


I used rollup.js to create a bundle for all the logic and SCSS for the CSS.
